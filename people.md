        I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, starting from August 2020. Prior to this appointment, I completed postdoctoral training at UC San Diego with [Dr. Rob Knight](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/). My academic background is multidisciplinary, with research experience and interest in bioinformatics, phylogenetics, microbiology, comparative genomics and molecular biology. I study both computational and biological questions, and strive to expand the understanding of the microbial world through its multiple levels: genes, genomes, lineages, communities, hosts, and environments.
